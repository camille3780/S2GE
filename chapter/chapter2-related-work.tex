    \section{Network Intrusion Detection System in IoT}
    In recent years, the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to an increased focus on developing effective network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) tailored to the specific characteristics of IoT environments. Various approaches have been proposed to address the challenges associated with high-volume, heterogeneous network traffic, constrained device capabilities, and evolving attack patterns. Kharoubi et al.~\cite{kharoubi2025nidscnn} proposed NIDS-DL-CNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detection system designed for IoT security. By applying CNN layers to extract spatial features from traffic data, the model achieved high classification performance on datasets such as CICIoT2023 and CICIoMT2024. The authors demonstrated that their method achieved excellent precision and recall in both binary and multi-class scenarios. However, a notable limitation of the CNN-based approach lies in its inability to fully capture temporal dependencies across packet sequences, and its reliance on supervised learning requires extensive labeled datasets. Ashraf et al.~\cite{ashraf2025inids} introduced a real-time intrusion detection system (INIDS) based on traditional machine learning classifiers applied to the BoT-IoT dataset. The study compared seven algorithms, including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines. Their results showed that Random Forest and ANN achieved the highest accuracy and robustness among all tested classifiers. Despite its efficiency, the INIDS system was highly dependent on manual feature engineering and lacked adaptability to novel threats, which are critical in fast-evolving IoT environments. Elrawy et al.~\cite{elrawy2018survey} conducted a comprehensive survey of intrusion detection methodologies in IoT-based smart environments, categorizing techniques according to architectural design (centralized vs. distributed), detection strategy (signature-based, anomaly-based, or hybrid), and system layer (perception, network, application). While the survey provided valuable insights and synthesized a broad range of IDS approaches, it lacked implementation evidence and empirical comparisons, limiting its utility for practical system design. Collectively, these studies highlight the trade-offs between detection performance, computational cost, and deployment feasibility. Deep learning models offer strong accuracy but demand computational resources, while traditional classifiers provide efficiency but often lack flexibility. In contrast, our proposed S2GE-NIDS framework leverages hash-based semantic embeddings and a lightweight MLP, offering a balanced approach that combines scalability, interpretability, and effectiveness in detecting network anomalies in resource-constrained IoT environments.

    \section{Tokenization}
    Following feature extraction, the next critical step is the tokenization process, which prepares network traffic data for semantic embedding. Each data record typically contains multiple fields—such as \texttt{Port}, \texttt{Protocol}, and \texttt{SrcIP}—representing structural and behavioral attributes of a network flow. To ensure consistency and distinguishability among features during embedding, we adopt a composite tokenization strategy that combines each field name with its corresponding value to form a unique token string. For instance, a sample token may take the form \texttt{Protocol:TCP} or \texttt{DstPort:443}.
    
    This strategy preserves the semantic association between field-value pairs without relying on predefined vocabularies, making it particularly suitable for dynamic and heterogeneous IoT environments. Each composite token is subsequently encoded using hash-based mapping techniques (as described in Section~\ref{sec:hash_embedding}), thereby eliminating the need for extensive memory allocation or manually constructed token dictionaries. By treating each token as a self-contained semantic unit, this method also enhances the model’s ability to generalize to previously unseen feature combinations, ultimately improving both the adaptability and scalability of the proposed system~\cite{weinberger2009feature}.
