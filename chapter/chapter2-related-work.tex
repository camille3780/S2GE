\subsection{Genetic Programming}
In \cite{akhmedova2024generationlossfunctionimage}, a genetic programming-based method was proposed to find a better function for the image classification training task. They encoded the loss functions into trees, with each tree considered an individual. All individuals were aggregated into a population. In this study, the population was evolved across multiple generations. Before the start of each generation, all individuals were evaluated. Each individual had a probability of undergoing crossover with an individual from a special external archive to create a new individual; otherwise, it would perform the crossover with another individual. Following this, two probabilistic decisions were made. If successful, the new individual could perform subtree mutation or one-point mutation, respectively. At the end of each generation, the fitness value of all individuals was re-evaluated. A certain number of low-scoring individuals were eliminated to the special external archive mentioned earlier, maintaining the stability of the population's size. After these steps, a new generation began, continuing until a predefined number of generations was reached.By employing this method, this study successfully evolved an outstanding individual within the population, creating a function that could train an image classification model more effectively compared to Cross Entropy.
